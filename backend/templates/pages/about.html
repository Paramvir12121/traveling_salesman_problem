    <h2>About the Traveling Salesman Problem</h2>
    <p>The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic problem in combinatorial optimization. The problem is to find the shortest possible route that visits a given set of cities and returns to the origin city. The problem is NP-hard, meaning that no polynomial-time algorithm is known to solve it. However, there are many approximate algorithms that can find good solutions in a reasonable amount of time.</p>
    <p>The TSP has many applications in real life, such as vehicle routing, logistics, and circuit board manufacturing. It is also a popular problem in computer science and operations research.</p>
    <p>This website provides a simple web-based interface for solving the TSP using various algorithms. You can input a list of cities and the algorithm will find the shortest route that visits all the cities exactly once and returns to the starting city.</p>
    <p>Feel free to try out the different algorithms and see how they perform on different sets of cities. You can also experiment with different parameters and settings to see how they affect the solution quality and running time.</p>
